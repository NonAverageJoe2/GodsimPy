> Can we make the armies appear on the gui, lets make them a gray rectangle

● I'll help you add army visualization to the GUI. Let me first find where other overlays are drawn and then add

● Perfect! I can see the render structure. Let me check if there's access to armies in the main.py GUI:

● Search(pattern: "world_state.*armies|armies|world.*armies", path: "D:\GodofPy\main.py", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines

● Let me check what the world_state object contains:

● Search(pattern: "class.*WorldState|def.*__init__.*world", path: "D:\GodofPy\sim\state.py", output_mode: "content")
